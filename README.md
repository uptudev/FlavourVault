# FlavourVault

FlavourVault is a recipe management software, which will provide anyone with a digital backup of their recipes. These "boxes" of recipes can be downloaded as a JSON file (or some other TBD format like RON or XML). Also planned are a printed export function to print out recipes.

This is a webapp built in Svelte, built to a static webpage, which is then served via Firebase and uses its Realtime Database for managing user boxes.
